# 'data' is a list of dictionaries separated by commas, where each dictionary
# contains two key-value pairs,
# key "word" and key "score"
# The objective of this program is to extract all the 'values' related to the
# "word" key and print them as a long string of words separated by commas.

# Find out how many elements has the list 'data'.
data_length = len(data)
# Create an empty list for storing values associated to key "word".

# Using a for loop, extract from each dictionary the 'value' corresponding
# to the key "word" or first key
for x in range(data_length):
    # Take the dictionary stored at 'data[x]', extract the 'value'
    # corresponding to key "word" and append it to 'out_list'.
    out_list.append(data[x]["word"])

# Now, out_list contains all the adjectives related to 'vegetable'
# To convert the list into a string containing all its elements,
# separated by a comma between each other, I will use the 'join()' function.
formatted_list = ", ".join(out_list)
# where
#   formatted_list is the output string
#   ", " is the separator, a comma followed by a space
#   .join is the function applied to out_list to obtain a string.

# Now, let's print the output
